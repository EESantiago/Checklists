# WORK IN PROGRESS

First step is to determine the file type:
```
file <FILE>
```



Use wineconsole to test windows executables:
```
wineconsole
```
Use a dissaembler for further analysis, specifically finding and analyzing strings:


IDA Pro
Radare 2
Objdump

## Binary Ninja

In Binary Ninja, open the file to display the GUI representation of the assembly code.  We can then use the strings function in the bootom right to view the strings and the address in memory where the strings are stored
